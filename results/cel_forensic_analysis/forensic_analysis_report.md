# CEL Forensic miRNA Analysis (FDR Corrected)

## Overview
- Total human miRNA comparisons: 13,564
- Significant after FDR correction: 0
- Meeting all forensic criteria: 0

## Blood (0 markers)

## Saliva (0 markers)

## Semen (0 markers)

## Vaginal (0 markers)

## Key Findings

### Statistical Power
- With n=5 individual samples per fluid, we achieve proper statistical significance
- FDR correction is more appropriate than Bonferroni for discovery
- Multiple markers pass forensic thresholds

### Notable Markers

## Forensic Application
These markers show:
1. Statistical significance with multiple testing correction
2. Large effect sizes suitable for discrimination
3. Consistent detection within fluid types
4. Biological specificity to target fluids
