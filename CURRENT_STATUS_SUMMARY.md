# Current Status Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Data Understanding ✓
- **Corrected dataset interpretation**: GPR = 10 arrays representing 26 pooled donors
- **CEL dataset**: 20 arrays = 20 individual donors
- **Key insight**: Cannot do individual-level statistics on pooled data

### 2. Analysis Framework ✓
- **Multi-tier detection system** implemented (high/moderate/low/below detection)
- **Continuous expression approach** rather than binary presence/absence
- **Appropriate statistics**: Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni correction
- **Forensic criteria defined**: >5-fold change, >80% detection, Cohen's d > 0.8

### 3. GPR Analysis Complete ✓
- Applied continuous expression framework
- Found NO markers meeting forensic criteria (expected with n=2)
- Identified some candidates with relaxed criteria
- Created comprehensive visualizations

## Key Findings

### Expression Distribution
- Only 14.4% of measurements in high confidence tier (>-2.0 log2)
- Most expression values are in moderate (-6 to -2) or low range
- Confirms miRNAs act as "dimmer switches" not binary

### Statistical Reality
- With n=2 pooled samples, Bonferroni correction eliminates all findings
- All p-values = 0.037 (minimum possible with n=2 rank test)
- Pooling reduces biological variability, may miss individual differences

### Quality Assessment
- All samples show good quality (>90% detection rate)
- Similar mean expression across samples (pooling effect)
- Clear clustering by fluid type

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Process CEL Data (CRITICAL)
- 20 individual samples = proper statistics possible
- Use oligo::rma() as recommended by agent analysis
- Expected to find actual forensic markers

### 2. CEL Statistical Analysis
- Apply same continuous framework
- Wilcoxon tests with n=5 per fluid
- Should yield significant findings after correction

### 3. Cross-Platform Validation
- Compare any CEL markers with GPR direction
- Use rank-based correlation (different scales)
- Higher confidence if found in both platforms

### 4. Probabilistic Reporting
- Calculate likelihood ratios for fluid identification
- Account for expression uncertainty
- Prepare court-friendly visualizations

## Why CEL Analysis is Critical

1. **Individual samples** - captures biological variability
2. **n=5 per fluid** - enables proper statistics
3. **Absolute values** - better for forensic thresholds
4. **No pooling artifacts** - true donor differences

## Expected Outcomes with CEL

With n=5 individual samples:
- 2-5 markers per fluid meeting forensic criteria
- Proper p-values and confidence intervals
- Validation of GPR candidates (if any)
- Foundation for forensic implementation

## Current Blockers

- R package installation still running (Bioconductor dependencies)
- Once complete, CEL processing is straightforward
- All analysis code ready to run on CEL data

## Time Estimate

- CEL processing: 30 minutes once R ready
- Statistical analysis: 1 hour
- Full report: 2 hours total

The groundwork is complete - we just need the CEL data processed to find real forensic markers.
