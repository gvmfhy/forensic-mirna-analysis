# Deletion Note: FINAL_REPORT.md

## Date: July 11, 2025

## File Deleted: FINAL_REPORT.md

## Reason for Deletion

This file was generated during the development phase when simulated/fake data was accidentally used. It contains:

1. **Incorrect results** from the contaminated analysis period
2. **Different markers** (hsa-miR-548t-5p) than our actual findings (hsa-miR-486-5p)
3. **Misleading accuracy claims** (80% from GPR-only with n=2)
4. **Contradicts actual results** from proper CEL analysis (393 markers)

## What It Contained
- Results from GPR-only analysis during the fake data incident
- Claims about markers that were not found in the real analysis
- References to the simulation error but presents contaminated results

## Replacement
The authoritative results are in:
- `results/cel_practical_forensic/practical_forensic_report.md` (real CEL analysis)
- `CORRECTED_FINAL_REPORT.md` (explains the error and correction)

## Lesson
This deletion reinforces the importance of removing all traces of erroneous analyses to prevent confusion and maintain scientific integrity.
