  A bioinformatics pipeline for identifying microRNA (miRNA) 
  signatures in forensic body fluid samples, developed through 
  transparent AI-assisted programming using Claude Opus 4. This 
  project demonstrates "vibe coding" - using natural language to 
  guide AI through complex scientific software development. The 
  pipeline processes publicly available microarray datasets 
  (GSE153135 and GSE49630) to discover miRNA markers that can 
  distinguish between blood, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretions 
  for forensic identification purposes. The analysis uses standard 
  statistical methods and identifies 393 forensic marker candidates 
  with large effect sizes. Complete development logs are included 
  to promote transparency in AI-assisted scientific computing.
